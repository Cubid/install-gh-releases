## Introduction

Fork of [jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release](https://github.com/jaxxstorm/action-install-gh-release) 
modified to install multiple releases at once and adopted to Cloud Posse's GitHub Actions standards.

Define set of GH releases to install as `config` input following the format:

* Short format: 
  ```yaml
    acme/repo-1: latest
  ```

  or 

  ```yaml
    acme/repo-1:
  ``` 
 
  which are equivalent
* Long format:  

  ```yaml
  acme/repo-4:
    tag: v0.1.0
    platform: linux
    arch: amd64
    ## Seek for `(tar.gz|zip|tgz)` archived asset (default "extension")
    extension-matching: true
  ```

Long format supports the following parameters:

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| skip | Set `true` to skip this release | `false` |
| tag | Tag containing binary to install | `latest` |
| platform | OS Platform to match in release package | `{platform of current runner}` |
| arch | OS Architecture to match in release package | `{arch of current runner}` |
| extension-matching | Set `true` to match extension in release package | `false` |
| extension | Extension match pattern | `tar.gz\|zip\|tgz` |
| rename-to | When installing a release that is not an archive, e.g. a pure binary, this controls how the downloaded release asset is renamed. | `null` |
| chmod | When installing a release that is not an archive, e.g. a pure binary, this controls how the downloaded release asset is chmod'd. | `null` |



## Usage



> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning GitHub Actions to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation 
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each GitHub Action to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your workflows. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic 
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
